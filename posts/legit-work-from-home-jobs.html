    <h1>How to Avoid Scams & Find Legit Work-From-Home Jobs</h1>

    <!-- INTRO -->
    <p class="article-intro">
      Work-from-home opportunities are more popular than ever — and unfortunately,
      so are scams.
      Beginners are often targeted because they’re eager to earn online.
      This guide will help you spot red flags, avoid fake offers,
      and find legitimate remote jobs safely.
    </p>

    <!-- SECTION -->
    <h2>Why Work-From-Home Scams Are So Common</h2>
    <p>
      Scammers know that remote work appeals to people seeking flexibility,
      extra income, or a career change.
      They use fake job listings, social media ads, and even professional-looking websites
      to appear legitimate.
    </p>

    <p>
      The good news? Once you know what to look for,
      scams become much easier to avoid.
    </p>

    <!-- SECTION -->

    <h2>Where to Find Legit Work-From-Home Jobs</h2>
    <p>
      Legitimate remote jobs exist — but they’re usually found on trusted platforms
      rather than random social media ads.
    </p>

    <h3>Trusted Sources Include:</h3>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li>Company career pages</li>
      <li>Reputable job boards</li>
      <li>Freelance marketplaces</li>
      <li>Remote-first companies</li>
      <li>Skill-based platforms</li>

    <!-- SECTION -->
    <h2>Why Skills Matter More Than Job Listings</h2>
    <p>
      Many beginners focus only on finding jobs,
      but the fastest way to avoid scams is to build real skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      Employers and platforms look for proof of ability —
      not desperation.
      Skills plus certificates create trust.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you’re unsure whether certificates help or hurt,
