    <h1>Free Online Courses With Certificates: What You Need to Know</h1>

    <p>
      Free online courses with certificates have become extremely popular, especially for people
      who want to work from home or change careers without spending money.
    </p>

    <p>
      But are these certificates really useful? Do employers take them seriously?
      And which platforms offer real value instead of meaningless badges?
    </p>

    <p>
      In this guide, you’ll learn how free certified courses work, when they are worth it,
      and how beginners can use them to start a remote career.
    </p>

    <!-- SECTION -->
    <h2>What Are Free Online Courses With Certificates?</h2>

    <p>
      Free online courses with certificates are educational programs you can access at no cost.
      After completing the course, you receive a certificate proving your participation or achievement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most platforms allow you to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Study at your own pace</li>
      <li>Learn job-ready skills</li>
      <li>Download or share certificates online</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Are Free Certificates Recognized by Employers?</h2>

    <p>
      The truth is simple: certificates alone don’t get you hired.
      However, they can strongly support your profile — especially if you have no experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Employers value certificates when they show:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Commitment to learning</li>
      <li>Basic technical or digital skills</li>
      <li>Consistency and self-discipline</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Open Learning Platforms</h3>
